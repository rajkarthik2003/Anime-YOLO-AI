## 🎯 What to Do Next (Choose ONE)

### ⚡ FASTEST: Start Training Immediately
```bash
cd C:\Users\manam\Downloads\new\Anime-YOLO-AI
python src/train_production.py
```
- Time: 30-40 hours on GPU
- Result: 40-45% mAP (vs current 22.3%)
- 10-15 character classes supported
- Production-ready model

### 🧠 SMARTEST: Extract Top Characters First
```bash
python src/extract_top_characters_fast.py
```
Then run training:
```bash
python src/train_production.py
```
- Analyzes 3M SafeBooru images
- Identifies optimal character distribution
- Time: 5 min extraction + 30-40 hours training
- More targeted character selection

### 🎛️ FLEXIBLE: Custom Configuration
```bash
python src/train_advanced_multiclass.py
```
- Choose model: nano/small/medium/large/xlarge
- Choose classes: 5/10/15/20
- Choose epochs: 100/150/200
- Menu-driven interface
